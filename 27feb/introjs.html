    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled)
        programming language
    </p>
    <p>
        It was Initially Lunched as a sister language of Java (Java was very
        Popular at that time)
    </p>
    <p>It was Initially Created in 1995 by Brenden Eich</p>
    <p>It was previously a part of Netscape and now it is a part of Oracle.</p>
    <p>It is a Event Driven Language i.e. Event Based Progamming Language.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is a Client side Scripting Language</li>
        <li>It is also used in Server Side (Node JS)</li>
        <li>It is a Dynamicly Language (Loosely Typed Language)</li>
        <li>It makes Our Website Interactive.</li>
        <li>It is the Brain of Frontend Development</li>
        <li>It also support object-oriented Programming</li>
        <li>JavaScript is a Single Threaded Language.</li>
        <li>It is also a Ashyncornus Language</li>
        <li>JavaScript is a Forgiving Language.</li>
        <li>
            The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written
            right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or
        actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript
        engine.
    </p>
    <p>
        The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual
        machine”.
    </p>
    <p>Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.</li>
        <li>SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.</li>
        <p>
            There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”,
            “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.</li>
        <li>React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.</li>
        <li>Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.</li>
        <li>Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).</li>
    </ul>
